Reddit Ban

My account was permanently banned. I have absolutely no idea why. The message I received says:

"Your account has been permanently suspended for using alternate accounts to evade a subreddit ban.
You are no longer welcome to use the site."

The same happened to the /u/ZenMasterBot acct, same message. No warning, no temporary ban, no contact in either account from other users or admins. The BuzzwordBot account seems untouched. It was also running on a Raspberry Pi but nobody had been using it. I have the three accounts, two of them for the bots, both registered with my main acct listed in the API as well as with every single post so I could be contacted if necessary.

I have written an appeal asking why, esp. since I have never been banned on any account or sub before, so the "alternate accounts" thing makes no sense to me (I am naive about Reddit, admittedly.) I rarely post outside of r/Buttcoin so I don't know what sub I was supposedly banned from and evading.

I don't know if others contacting the admins can help or just make things worse? I don't see why I'd be banned, as I follow the rules, don't get into arguments, etc. Anyone can check my post history to confirm.

I'm waiting for if/when I get a reply on the appeal. I'll check the thread posted on /r/Buttcoin periodically for feedback & advice. It's a shame this mistake has happened and hopefully I can get my account/ZenBot restored but Reddit's not a super-high priority TBH.

Thanks for all the kinds words and support. Cheers!

P.S. I won't be creating another account, using Tor, etc. to try to evade the ban. I'd rather work it out with the admins and it's not my thing to bypass rules.
